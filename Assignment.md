# JavaScript Control-Flow & Loops: Assignment

## Problems

### 1: Nightclub Bouncer

Using an `if/else` expression, write code that prompts the user for their age, then:

- If the user is older than 18, he/she should receive a message that he/she may enter.
- If the user is younger than 18, then he/she can't enter and should receive a message telling him/her that he/she's too young.
- If the user is between 18 and 21, he/she should receive a message that he/she can enter, but not drink.
- If the user is older than 21, he/she should receive a message that he/she can both enter and drink.

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 2: Fizzbuzz

This might feel like a abstract problem. But trust us, it frequently comes up during technical interviews when you are applying for a role as a Software Engineer. So you might as well get a head start on it with a basic version of Fizzbuzz.

In case you are wondering what is [Fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) about. Also, you're going to need the [remainder/modulus operator​](https://javascript.info/operators#remainder) for this.

For version 1 of this problem, only use `if/elseif/else` expressions to solve it.

- Write a program that declares a variable with a random value between 0 and 100 picked by you
- If it is a multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number
- If it is a multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number
- If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number
- Otherwise, print the number

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 3: The Grade Assigner

- Using a `for` loop check each value from `60` to `100`
- For every value, your `console.log` should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc.

**Legend:**

- A: `90-100`
- B: `80-89`
- C: `70-79`
- D: `60-69`

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 4: Favorite TV Shows

1. Create an Array to hold your favorite TV shows
1. For each show, print to the console a string like:

   ```
   My #1 choice is Person of Interest
   My #2 choice is Battlestar Galactica
   ```

```js
// Your Answer
```

### 5: Age Filter

1. Create an Array to hold a list of ages
1. Loop through and log only the ages that are over 21

```js
// Your Answer
```

## Optional Bonus Problems

You don't have to complete these problems. They are only provided as an extra challenge if you are hungary for more practice.

### 1: Change Odd Numbers

Change all **odd numbers** in the Array to their value multiplied by 2:

```js
const numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

// Your Answer

console.log(numbers); // => [4, 18, 14, 2, 2, 8]
```
